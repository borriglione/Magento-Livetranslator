Livetranslator
==============

This extension provides the ability to enable inline translation from backend just for the current user.

To do so just open your Magento backend under System->Configuration->Developer and click on the `Enable inline
translation for this session` link.

A new window will be opened with inline translation enabled. Unlike the normal Magento behaviour translation is only
enabled for this particular user. Customers and other backend users are not able to see the links.

*Note:* The backend link will be deactivated after 60 seconds for security reasons. If this happens just reload the
backend page to enable it again.
